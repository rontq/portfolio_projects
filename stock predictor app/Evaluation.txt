Progress:
- Data ingestion and preparation for initialization is finished. 
- Updating database files still needs clean up and fault proofing. 

Performance: 
- Prior 25-32 hours to go through intialization pipeline. Sector/subsector indices and values took ~24 hours.
-Current: Updated code to go through the init pipeline in about 1-2 hours.


-Scalability: 
-Can be scaled to predict sector pe
